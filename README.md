# Real-Time-Sensor-Stream-with-Apache-Kafka
This project demonstrates basic streaming data concepts using Apache Kafka and Python. It simulates IoT sensor readings, produces them to a Kafka topic, consumes the data in real time, and performs a simple 10-second windowed count to show basic event stream processing.
